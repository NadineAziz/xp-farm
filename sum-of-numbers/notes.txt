Sum of Numbers
Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, 
find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. 
If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Note: a and b are not ordered!


Examples: 
(1, 0) --> 1 (1 + 0 = 1)
(1, 2) --> 3 (1 + 2 = 3)
(0, 1) --> 1 (0 + 1 = 1)
(1, 1) --> 1 (1 since both are same)
(-1, 0) --> -1 (-1 + 0 = -1)
(-1, 2) --> 2 (-1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2)

Pomodoro 1:
- Initial setup of program
- Possible user stories and Scenarios

User Story 1:
As two given numbers I want to find the range between them to get their sum

Scenario 1:
Given a=0 and b=0 when I sum them up then should give me 0

Scenario 2:
Given a=1 and b=0 when I sum them up then should give me 1


Scenario 2:
Given a=1 and b=2 when I sum them up then should give me 3
