Implement a function likes :: [String] -> String, which must take in input array, containing the 
names of people who like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

likes [] -- must be "no one likes this"
likes ["Peter"] -- must be "Peter likes this"
likes ["Jacob", "Alex"] -- must be "Jacob and Alex like this"
likes ["Max", "John", "Mark"] -- must be "Max, John and Mark like this"
likes ["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"] -- must be "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"
For 4 or more names, the number in and 2 others simply increases.


Rules:
1 like -> name1
2 likes -> name1 and name2
num likes -> name1,name2, and num others

Tests:
[] -> no one likes this
["Nadeen"] -> Nadeen likes this
["Nadeen","Griffin"] -> Nadeen and Griffin like this
["Nadeen","Griffin","Louis"] -> Nadeen, Griffin, and Louis like this
["Nadeen","Griffin","Louis","Max"] -> Nadeen, Griffin and 2 others like this
