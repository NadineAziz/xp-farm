Task
King Arthur and his knights are having a New Years party. Last year Lancelot was jealous of Arthur, because Arthur had a date and Lancelot did not, and they started a duel.

To prevent this from happening again, Arthur wants to make sure that there are at least as many women as men at this year's party. He gave you a list of integers of all the party goers.

Arthur needs you to return true if he needs to invite more women or false if he is all set.

Notes:
1  : represents men
-1 : represents women

🗒️ Senario 1:
As King Arthur has a party
He wants to invite no one
So that so he could eat all the sushi

User Story 1:
Given that there is a party
When king author invites no one
Then it should fail because he will have no date


🗒️ Senario 2:
As King Arthur has a party
He wants to invite only men
So that so he could eat all the sushi and they don't dare

User Story 1:
Given that there is a party
When king author invites one man
Then it should fail because he will have no date

User Story 2:
Given that there is a party
When king author invites 3 men
Then it should fail because he will have no date


🗒️ Senario 3:
As King Arthur has a party
He wants to invite more men than women
So that so he could have the chance for a date

User Story 1:

When king author invites 2 men and 1 woman
Then it should fail because she might not like him (he doesn't share sushi)

User Story 2:
Given that there is a party
When king author invites 5 men and 3 woman
Then it should fail because Authur is eating sushi and getting all the women


🗒️ Senario 4:
As King Arthur has a party
He wants to invite equal amount of men and women
So that so he could have the chance for a date

As King Arthur has a party
He wants to invite more women than men
So that so he could have the chance for a date
