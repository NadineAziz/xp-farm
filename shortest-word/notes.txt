Pomodoro 1:
- init program 
- write possible scenarios

User Story 1: As shortest word finder I want to count the length of each word in the sentence so that I find the minimum length

Scenario 1: Given a sentence with 1 word  ['w'] when I find the minimum length then I get length = 1
Scenario 2: Given a sentence with 2 words ['cv np'] with the same length when I find the minimum length then I get length = 2
Scenario 3: Given a sentence with 2 words ['cv npm'] with different lengths then I get length = 2
Scenario 4: Given a sentence with 3 words ['I do know'] then I get get length = 1
Scenario 5: Given a sentence with 5 words ['Anything about this for sure'] then I get length = 3
