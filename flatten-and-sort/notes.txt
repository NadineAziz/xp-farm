Given a two-dimensional array of integers, return the flattened version of the array with all the 
integers in the sorted (ascending) order.

Example:

Given [[3, 2, 1], [4, 6, 5], [], [9, 7, 8]], your function should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

Pomodoro 1:
- Init program
- Write possible User Story and Scenarios

User Story 1:
As an array with empty arrays I want to not do anything to return an empty array

Scenario 1:Given an empty array [] when I try to flatten and sort it so that it gives back an empty array []

Scenario 2:Given an empty array [[],[]] when I try to flatten and sort it then it gives back an empty array []

User Story 2:
As an array with single number I want to flatten it so that it returns a single element array

Scenario 1:Given a single element array [[],[1]] when I try to flatten and sort it then it gives back [1]
Scenario 2:Given a single element array [[2],[]] when I try to flatten and sort it then it gives back [2]


User Story 3:
As an array with 2 numbers I want to flatten it so that it returns a single array

Scenario 1: Given an array [[1], [2]] I want to flatten it to return a single array [1,2]
Scenario 2: Given an array [[3],[4]] I want to flatten t to return a single array [3,4]

User Story 4:
As an array with numbers unsorted (same length) I want to flatten and sort it so that it returns a single sorted array

Scenario 1: Given an array [[2], [1]] I want to flatten it and sort it to return a single array [1,2]
Scenario 2: Given an array [[4,3],[1,2]] I want to flatten t to return a single array [1,2,3,4]

User Story 5:
As an array with numbers unsorted (different length) I want to flatten and sort it so that it returns a single sorted array

Scenario 1: Given an array [[5,2], [1]] I want to flatten it and sort it to return a single array [1,2,5]
Scenario 2: Given an array [[4,8,2],[1,2]] I want to flatten t to return a single array [1,2,2,4,8]
Scenario 3: Given an array [[3, 2, 1], [7, 9, 8], [6, 4, 5]] I want to flatten it and sort it to return a single array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Scenario 4: Given an array [[1, 3, 5], [100], [2, 4, 6]] I want to flatten t to return a single array  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 100]
