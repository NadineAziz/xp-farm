Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) (or compSame(a, b)) that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" 
elements, with the same multiplicities. "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order.

Pomodoro1:
- Set up project
- Write possible Tests
- Write User Stories and Scenario

User Story 1 :
As 2 arrays with at most single elements, I want to compare myself to another array, so that I find my squares

Scenario 1 :
Given 2 empty arrays when I try to compare them then gives false

Scenario 2 :
Given 2 arrays a=[1] b=[1] when I try to compare them then gives true

Scenario 3 :
Given 2 arrays a=[2] b=[4] when I try to compare them then gives true

Scenario 4 :
Given 2 arrays a=[3] b=[1] when I try to compare them then gives false
