⚠️ The world is in quarantine! There is a new pandemia that struggles mankind. Each continent is isolated from each other but infected people have spread before the warning. ⚠️

Rules: 
⚫ The virus can't spread in the other side of the ocean.

⚫ If one person is infected every person in this continent gets infected too.

⚫ Your task is to find the percentage of human population that got infected in the end.

☑️ Return the percentage % of the total population that got infected.

❗❗ The first and the last continent are not connected!
➕ For maps without oceans "X" the whole world is connected.

➕ For maps without "0" and "1" return 0 as there is no population.

Example: 
 start: map1 = "01000000X000X011X0X"
 end:   map1 = "11111111X000X111X0X"
 total = 15
 infected = 11
 percentage = 100*11/15 = 73.33333333333333
