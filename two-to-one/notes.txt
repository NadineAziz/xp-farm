Take 2 strings s1 and s2 including only letters from ato z. Return a new sorted string, the longest possible, containing distinct letters, - each taken only once - coming from s1 or s2.

Examples:
a = "xyaabbbccccdefww"
b = "xxxxyyyyabklmopq"
longest(a, b) -> "abcdefklmopqwxy"
a = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
longest(a, a) -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"


Pomodoro 1:
- Project Setup
- Possible Scenarios

User Story 1:
As I have 2 strings with single letters I want to apply a function on them so that I get a sorted unique list.

Scenario 1:
Given strings a and b when I sort/unique them then it should return 'ab'

Scenario 2:
Given strings c and d when I sort/unique them then it should return 'cd'

User Story 2:
As I have 2 strings with double letters I want to apply a function on them so that I get a sorted unique list.

Scenario 1:
Given strings ab and cd when I sort/unique them then it should return 'abcd'

Scenario 2:
Given strings ab and bd when I sort/unique them then it should return 'abd'

User Story 3:
As I have 2 strings with 3 letters I want to apply a function on them so that I get a sorted unique list.

Scenario 1:
Given strings abc and cde when I sort/unique them then it should return 'abcde'

Scenario 2:
Given strings lmn and opp when I sort/unique them then it should return 'lmnop'

User Story 4:
As I have 2 strings with mixed number of letters I want to apply a function on them so that I get a sorted unique list.

Scenario 1:
Given strings abfg and saasw when I sort/unique them then it should return 'abfgsw'

Scenario 2:
Given strings aretheyhere and yestheyarehere when I sort/unique them then it should return 'aehrsty'

Scenario 3:
Given strings xyaabbbccccdefww and xxxxyyyyabklmopq when I sort/unique them then it should return 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

Scenario 4:
Given strings inmanylanguages and theresapairoffunctions when I sort/unique them then it should return 'acefghilmnoprstuy'
